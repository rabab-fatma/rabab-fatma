# Hi, I'm Rabab 👋

I'm an M.S. Bioinformatics student at Georgia Tech (Dec 2025) and a computational biologist-in-training who loves building **reproducible, scalable pipelines** for genomics and epitranscriptomics.

I’ve worked across:
- 🧬 **Epitranscriptomics:** BID-seq pipelines for high-resolution pseudouridine (Ψ) detection in uterine fibroid RNA-seq
- 🦠 **Comparative genomics:** Large-scale E. coli & ESKAPEE pan-genome analysis with ML for resistance and niche prediction
- 🌊 **Microbial communities:** 16S rRNA analysis of inland water microbiomes
- 🧪 **Structural biology:** Homology modeling & docking for Leishmania autophagy pathway proteins

I care about clean pipelines, clear documentation, and making it easy for collaborators to rerun analyses end-to-end.

## 🔭 What I’m working on

- Building **Snakemake + Nextflow** workflows for NGS (RNA-seq, BID-seq, pan-genomes)
- Integrating **ML models (XGBoost, SHAP)** to interpret genomic features
- Running pipelines on **HPC clusters and AWS** with Dockerized workflows
- Turning class projects and research scripts into reusable, open pipelines
